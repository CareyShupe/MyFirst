# Hello GitHub Community!

I have been learning to program since the days of MS-DOS Basic. I am self-taught from books and have faced many challenges, including errors, dial-up connections, and bulletin boards for answers.I also took Community College programming classes in C, Pascal, Cobol, and RPG while working as a diesel technician. I would love to hear from you all. I will finish a script and post it on this repository.

This is my first using Git and first Github Project. I published this project directly from visual studio code.
