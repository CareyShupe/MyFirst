Hello GitHub Community!
I have started learning to program since MS DOS Basic. From books I self taught myself, and struggle with errors, dial-up and bulletin board for answers.
I took Community College programming at the time C, Pascal, Cobol and RPG I think that what it was called while working as a diesel tech.
I would like to here from all. I will finish a script and post it on this repository.
